# alASHandria - a library that burns all the books all the time.

This is just a simple library architecture built in Elixir using Ash Framework. Using GraphQL as the interface.

## Installation

Do you got Elixir installed in your machine? So:...

```
mix deps.get
iex -S mix
```

Just it, welcome.

Oh, the rest of the doc ðŸ˜²? Oh no... I think I burned it by accident.
